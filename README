This package is a subclass of Math::BigInt and was inspired by Chris London
Noll's 'number.pl' program.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

See ./examples/number.pl for how to use this package on a webserver or on the
command line.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
